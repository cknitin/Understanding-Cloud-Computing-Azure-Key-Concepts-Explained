---

## **20. Routes**

### **What is it?**
Routes determine where network traffic is sent. They are defined using route tables and are used in custom or advanced networking scenarios.

### **Use Case:**
Traffic from a public subnet is routed through a firewall before reaching the private subnet.

### **Interview Question:**
**Q: What is a default route in Azure?**  
**A:** A route that directs all unmatched traffic to a specified next hop, such as a firewall appliance.

---

## **21. Route Tables**

### **What is it?**
A route table contains a set of rules (routes) that control how packets are directed in a VNet. Each subnet can be associated with a custom route table.

### **Use Case:**
A company configures a route table to send all outbound traffic through a network virtual appliance for inspection.

### **Interview Question:**
**Q: Can multiple subnets use the same route table?**  
**A:** Yes, one route table can be assigned to multiple subnets.

---

## **22. NSG (Network Security Group)**
